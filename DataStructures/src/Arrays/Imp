Important questions

merge K sorted arrays - Min heap/ priority queue
find kth smallest element in sorted matrix - Min heap/ priority queue
search in sorted matrix - start from matrix[0][noOfColumns-1]
Median in row wise sorted matrix - calc min element, max element, median-index , (mid = (min+max)/2) 
									Binary search in all rows and count for places of left of mid.
									if(places < median) min = mid + 1;
									else max = mid;
						return min;

Minimum number of swaps to sort array - copy and sort temp array of Pair(value, position, visited) compare pair visited & i
Minimum number of adjacent swaps - merge sort with helper array inv_count += mid -i when not sorted;
Count inversion - merge sort with helper array inv_count += mid -i when not sorted;
